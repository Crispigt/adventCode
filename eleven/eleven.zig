//If num = 0 => 1
//If num.len % 2 = 0 => split number eg. 10 = 1 and 0, no leading zeroes 00 = 0
//Else num * 2024

//Maybe a tree would be good, where each node is the number, if split we get two new nodes below,
//one
//Otherwise maybe an array where each number has it's own arraylist and we remove then add the splitet number
//we rebuild the full number by going through and
//Only problematic part is that we have to shift everything to add a new number inbetween
//Otherwise a linked list makes it easy to add and remove numbers
// Going with a linked list, then we check each of the things through functions,
// That is the above functions, also need to implement a linked list, with custom functions
// to add and remove based on the above
